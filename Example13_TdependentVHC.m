%% Decription
% This example showcases the option of letting the thermal media properties
% depend on temperature. A medium is defined that has a volumetric heat
% capacity (VHC) that increases drastically when the temperature is around
% 40°C. Such a medium is not particularly realistic, but serves to
% showcase the feature.
%
% As the medium heats up, the regions that approach 40°C will not heat
% much further due to the very high VHC, despite still absorbing the same
% power as before. In the plot, the yellow color (40°C) can be seen to
% extend further and further down into the medium as time goes, but even
% the top layer has not become white (45°C) by the end of the
% simulation.
%
% In models where optical or thermal properties depend on temperature or
% fractional damage, it is very important for the user to test whether
% mediaProperties(j).nBins and model.HS.nUpdates are set high enough and
% model.HS.mediaPropRecalcPeriod low enough for a suitably converged
% result.
