%% Post-processing

%% Geometry function(s)
% A geometry function takes as input X,Y,Z matrices as returned by the
% "ndgrid" MATLAB function as well as any parameters the user may have
% provided in the definition of Ginput. It returns the media matrix M,
% containing numerical values indicating the media type (as defined in
% mediaPropertiesFunc) at each voxel location.

% The media properties function defines all the optical and thermal
% properties of the media involved by constructing and returning a
% "mediaProperties" struct with various fields. As its input, the function
% takes the wavelength as well as any other parameters you might specify
% above in the model file, for example parameters that you might loop over
% in a for loop. Dependence on excitation fluence rate FR, temperature T or
% fractional heat damage FD can be specified as in examples 12-15.
