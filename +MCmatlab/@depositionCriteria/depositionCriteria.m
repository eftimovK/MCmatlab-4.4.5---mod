classdef depositionCriteria
% List of criteria for when a photon's weight loss should be deposited in
% any output arrays. All the criteria have to be met simultaneously - there
% is an implied AND between them all.

% The minMediumIdxToConsider and maxMediumIdxToConsider are different in
% that they specify which media the above criteria are for. For example, if
% you've specified minScatterings = 2, minMediumIdxToConsider = 4 and
% maxMediumIdxToConsider = 5, then only photons that have experienced at
% least 2 scattering events in media 4 and/or 5 will deposit their
% weight in the output arrays. It doesn't matter how many scattering events
% have happened in other media.

% Interface transitions and refractions will be considered if the medium
% transitioned *into* has index between minMediumIdxToConsider and
% maxMediumIdxToConsider.

% The user can rearrange the media in the media definition as required so
% that the set of media that he/she wants to consider in deposition
% criteria are in a contiguous interval.

% If evaluateOnlyAtEndOfLife is false, the photons will deposit weight into
% the output arrays only in those segments of the paths where the criteria
% are satisfied. If it is true, weight is deposited along the full path if
% the criteria are satisfied at the end of the photon's life span.

% If evaluateOnlyAtEndOfLife is true, you may also specify onlyCollected.
% It is an extra criterion that states that the photon must have been
% collected on the light collector.
