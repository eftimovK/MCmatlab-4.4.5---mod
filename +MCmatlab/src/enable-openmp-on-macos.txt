Thanks to Will Grissom who figured this method out for his tool kpTx (https://github.com/wgrissom)

The following strategy worked for MATLAB R2022a running on Mac OS Ventura, 13.0:

- Install XCode from the App Store and, subsequently, the Apple Command Line Tools: fire up a terminal and type "xcode-select --install"
- Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh
- Use Homebrew to install LLVM and OpenMP: brew install llvm libomp
- Tell MATLAB to use a custom MEX setup for C compilation, which points to your llvm compiler and includes OpenMP flags: mex -setup:/path/to/clang_openmp_maci64.xml C (clang_openmp_maci64.xml is included in this repo)
Compile using: mex COPTIMFLAGS='$COPTIMFLAGS -Ofast -fopenmp -std=c11 -Wall' LDOPTIMFLAGS='$LDOPTIMFLAGS -Ofast -fopenmp -std=c11 -Wall' -outdir +MCmatlab/@model/private ./+MCmatlab/src/MCmatlab.c
