%% Description
% This example illustrates refraction and reflection using the smoothed and
% interpolated Sobel filter method published by A. Tran and S. Jacques in
% J. of Biomedical Optics, 25(2), 025001 (2020)
% https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.25.2.025001).
%
% This example reproduces figure 3 of that paper. A hemispherical droplet
% of water is surrounded by air and an infinite plane wave is incident on
% it. The two media, of course, have different refractive indices and the
% normal vectors of the droplet surface are calculated using a Sobel filter
% and smoothed at a length scale of model.MC.smoothingLengthScale.
%
% The focusing effect of the droplet is clearly visible when looking at the
% photon paths. The probability of reflection is greater near the edges due
% to the grazing angles of incidence. You will see some voxelization
% artifacts in the light distribution near the edges of the droplet, which
% are unavoidable with this method but will be less significant if the
% resolution is increased.

% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
