%% Description
% Here, we demonstrate calculation and plotting of the far field angular
% distribution of the "escaped" photons, both for excitation light and for
% fluorescence light. It is enabled by specifying the optional
% "farFieldRes" parameter, which serves also to specify the resolution you
% want of the far field distribution. The geometry is almost the same
% fluorescing cylinder as example 5, but now illuminated by a tilted
% Gaussian beam and now with only one type of fluorescer.
%
% In the far field of the excitation light, you can see that they primarily
% escape in downward-pointing directions (in transmission), while the far
% field distribution of fluorescence light indicates that fluorescence
% mostly escapes on the ends of the cylinder, with a small amount of light
% coming out of the cylinder in the minus z direction (upwards).
%
% Note that MCmatlab distinguishes between "escaped" photons and "killed"
% photons. An "escaping" photon is one that hits the top cuboid boundary
% (if boundaryType == 2) or any cuboid boundary (if boundaryType == 1)
% where the medium has refractive index 1. A "killed" photon is one that
% strays too far from the main cuboid (5 times further than the cuboid
% dimensions).
%
% If boundaryType == 1, there are no "killed" photons since no photons can
% travel outside the cuboid, and the fraction of light absorbed in the
% cuboid plus the fraction of light escaping equals 1.

%% MCmatlab abbreviations
% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
