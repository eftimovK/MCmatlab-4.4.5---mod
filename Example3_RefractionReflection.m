%% Description
% This example illustrates simulation of refraction and reflection
% according to Fresnel's equations. This requires the matchedInterfaces flag
% to be set to false. The geometry consists of three layers: At the bottom
% is a reflector such as metal (n = infinity), at the top is air (n = 1)
% and in between is water (n = 1.3). The light source is an isotropically
% emitting (equally emitting in all directions) source located inside the
% water layer. The rays can be seen to be reflected from the bottom
% interface and also to an extent from the top interface, although some
% light is also refracted out of the water.
%
% This example also shown the optional "useAllCPUs" flag that can be set on
% the MC simulations to slightly increase speed. Default is false, which
% means the solver leaves one CPU unused, making it easier to perform other
% work on the PC while simulations are running. Note that multithreading is
% anyway only supported on Windows. On Mac, useAllCPUs is ignored.
%
% Additionally, the optional "nExamplePaths" parameter is demonstrated, a
% value specifying the number of photons whose paths should be stored and
% shown as lines in a 3D plot after completion.

%% MCmatlab abbreviations
% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
