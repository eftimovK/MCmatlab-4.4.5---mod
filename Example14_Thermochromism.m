%% Decription
% This example demonstrates simulations in which the absorption coefficient
% is dependent on temperature, such as in a thermochromic material. For a
% introduction to how fluence rate or temperature dependent optical or
% thermal properties are binned, see example 12.
%
% The geometry is a wedge of thermochromic material suspended in water over
% a plane sheet of the same thermochromic material. A focused Gaussian beam
% is incident on the wedge with a slight tilt in the -y direction. The mua
% property of the thermochromic material is defined as a char array using
% standard MATLAB syntax in such a way that mua = 150 for T = 20 deg C but
% drops linearly with temperature until it bottoms out at 1e-8 for T = 40
% deg C.
%
% The light is on for 200 ms and 50 plotting updates are requested.
% HS.mediaPropRecalcPeriod is set to 2 which means that every 2 updates (8
% ms), the heat simulation is paused while the media properties of the
% incident light are recalculated and the fluence rate is found again by
% re-running the Monte Carlo step. Monte Carlo results are plotted both
% before and after the heat simulations.
%
% In models where optical or thermal properties depend on temperature or
% fractional damage, it is very important for the user to test whether
% mediaProperties(j).nBins and model.HS.nUpdates are set high enough and
% model.HS.mediaPropRecalcPeriod low enough for a suitably converged
% result.
