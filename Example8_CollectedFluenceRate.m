%% Description
% This example shows how to use one of the "deposition criteria" to
% calculate and plot the fluence rate (and the other outputs) of only that
% light which ends up on the light collector. The geometry is a block of
% standard tissue, into which we launch a Gaussian beam. We have a light
% collector looking at y = -0.02.
%
% We specify that we only want to look at those photons that end up on the
% light collector with model.MC.depositionCriteria.onlyCollected = true;
% See examples 19 and 25 for more use of the deposition criteria.
% 
% In the fluence rate plot, you can see how the photons all start at the
% source and end at the light collector. This is also very clear in the
% photon paths plot.
%
% To use a light collector, the cuboid boundary type towards the detector
% has to be set to "escaping". Additionally, the voxels touching that
% boundary must have a refractive index of 1.
%
% This example also shows two other features: (1) That the Monte Carlo
% simulation can be set to launch a set number of photons rather than run
% for a set time using the MC.nPhotonsRequested property, and (2) that by
% setting the boundaryType flags to 2, we can allow photons to travel
% outside the cuboid in the x, y, and +z directions as seen in the photon
% paths illustrations, although absorption and fluence rate data is still
% only tracked within the main cuboid.

% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
