%% Description
% In this example, we demonstrate that model outputs can be combined with
% each other using the combineModels() function. This can be useful, for
% example, when you want to have multiple input light sources, such as
% beams. It can also be useful for heavy simulations that require a lot of
% statistics, so you might have run the same simulation on multiple
% different PCs and would like to combine the results.
%
% This example is almost the same as example 1, except that we start by
% naming the model "model1" instead of the usual "model". It has a shifted
% y position of the input pencil beam and a power (model1.MC.P) of 1
% watt.
%
% Then we copy this model into a new model called "model2", and we give
% model2 a new beam y position and a different power, 0.1 watts.
%
% We run the Monte Carlo simulation on both of these models individually,
% and then use the combineModels() function to combine the results into one
% model called "combinedModel".
%
% This combined model object now contains properties where the input objects'...
% - nPhotons and simulationTime have been added
% - examplePaths have been concatenated
% - image, normalizedFluenceRate, farField and all the normalizedIrradiance
%   arrays have been set to weighted means
% If all the light sources (model.MC.LS) and input powers (model.MC.P) are
% identical we assume that the objects are being combined simply to gather
% more statistics, so the weights used for the mean are the numbers of
% photons in each simulation, nPhotons. If they are not identical, we
% assume that we are combining simulations with different light sources, as
% is the case in this example, and the weights used are the powers,
% model.MC.P.
%
% When plotting the combined model output, you see the two pencil beams in
% the cuboid, with one having five times the power of the other.

% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
