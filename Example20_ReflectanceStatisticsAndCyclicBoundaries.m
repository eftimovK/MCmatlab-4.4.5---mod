%% Description
% In this example, we show two things: The use of cyclic boundary
% conditions and how to calculate the reflectance of a sample, including
% how to provide an estimate of the statistical error of the value.
%
% The geometry is similar to that of example 1, although we will run it
% both with and without matched interfaces here. We place a thin layer of
% air, 1 voxel thick, at the top of the cuboid and fill the rest with
% "standard tissue". The thin layer of air is necessary to enforce specular
% reflectance of the incident beam and to include the reflection and
% refraction effects at the surface.
%
% We want to calculate the total and diffuse reflectance of the tissue, so
% we don't want photons to escape at the side walls and disappear from the
% simulation. One possibility for how to avoid this is to use a cuboid with
% very large Lx and Ly. Another is to use cyclic boundary conditions, which
% we employ here by setting model.MC.boundaryType = 3. With cyclic boundary
% conditions, all photons that hit a side wall will immediately enter the
% cuboid again on the opposite wall. Because our geometry is supposed to
% represent a slab of tissue with infinite horizontal extent, this is a
% valid way for us to avoid losing photons to side wall effects.
%
% We will calculate the reflectance by integrating the
% model.MC.normalizedIrradiance_zneg 2D array, which contains all the power
% that has hit the top cuboid boundary from the inside. In principle, the x
% and y resolution can be set as low as the minimum value, 2x2 and still
% get the same result (try it). For visualization purposes, however, we
% keep nx and ny at reasonable values of 101 in this example. Also Lx and
% Ly could be set arbitrarily low due to the use of the cyclic boundaryType.
%
% The reflectance that we calculate is the total reflectance, including the
% specular reflection that we get when simulating without matched
% interfaces. We can obtain the diffuse reflectance by subtracting the
% Fresnel reflectivity, ((1 - 1.4)/(1 + 1.4))^2, from the total
% reflectance. Another way of avoiding the specular reflectance would
% have been to set depositionCriteria.minInterfaceTransitions = 1, but we
% do not use that method here.
%
% To get some statistics, we launch 1e6 photons 5 times and collect the
% diffuse reflectance value for each run. Then we finally write out the
% mean and the standard error of the mean for both the calculation with
% matched interfaces and without.
