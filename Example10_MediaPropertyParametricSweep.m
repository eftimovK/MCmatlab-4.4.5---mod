%% Description
% This example is another illustration of MC simulations inside a for loop,
% this time simulating a pencil beam incident on a 100 µm slab of scattering
% medium with a variable (parametrically sweeped) scattering anisotropy g.
% g is passed in through the mediaPropParams field and used within
% mediaPropertiesFunc. Light is collected in transmission at a 45° angle in
% a fiber, similar to example 8. At the end of the script, collected power
% as a function of g is plotted. The power is seen to be zero for g = +- 1,
% which is because then the light can only be scattered exactly forward or
% backward. The max is at about 0.6, fitting well with a single scattering
% event at 45°. There is a secondary hump around -0.7, which fits with
% photons experiencing two scattering events at a scattering angle of
% 157.5°.
%
% As in example 9, calcNFR is again set to false to speed up the simulation
% slightly.
%
% The results of the last run will be plotted and MCmatlab will give a
% warning because in that last one, no photons were collected in the
% detector. This is not a problem in our case since we were expecting this.

%% MCmatlab abbreviations
% G: Geometry, MC: Monte Carlo, FMC: Fluorescence Monte Carlo, HS: Heat
% simulation, M: Media array, FR: Fluence rate, FD: Fractional damage.
%
% There are also some optional abbreviations you can use when referencing
% object/variable names: LS = lightSource, LC = lightCollector, FPID =
% focalPlaneIntensityDistribution, AID = angularIntensityDistribution, NI =
% normalizedIrradiance, NFR = normalizedFluenceRate.
%
% For example, "model.MC.LS.FPID.radialDistr" is the same as
% "model.MC.lightSource.focalPlaneIntensityDistribution.radialDistr"
